          1. THE PLATFORM
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Platform Purpose:</strong> Play2Earn ("Play2Earn", "us", "our", or "we") is designed to enable you to complete various tasks and receive payouts for your efforts ("Payouts"). When you complete a task through the Platform, we resell it to our partners.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Platform’s functionality includes:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
            <li>Allowing you to complete tasks within the Platform to earn rewards.</li>
            <li>Displaying the amount of earnings you have accumulated within the Platform, as well as the current value of Play2Earn tokens (P2E).</li>
            <li>Enabling you to request a Payout to receive your earnings in the form of P2E tokens to a connected crypto wallet.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Play2Earn Token (P2E):</strong> The cryptocurrency used to issue Payouts for your earnings through the Platform. All Payouts you receive via the Platform will be in P2E Tokens and sent to the crypto wallet you have connected with the Platform.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">
          2. THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS AND SURVEYS
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While using the Play2Earn Platform, you may encounter opportunities to access and utilize applications or surveys provided by third parties to earn rewards. Your participation in these third-party applications or surveys is entirely at your own discretion and risk.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Play2Earn is not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, content, requested permissions, products, or outcomes resulting from your use of these third-party applications or surveys. We do not guarantee that participation in these applications or surveys will always result in the earnings described within the Platform, especially in cases where device permissions are required for the third-party application.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with any terms and conditions that may apply to your access or use of these third-party applications or surveys before participating.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">
          3. ACCOUNT
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Signing Up:</strong> To start using the Play2Earn Platform, you must first sign in using one of the supported crypto wallets. You can do this in the following way:
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
            <li>Select a Supported Wallet: Choose from the list of crypto wallets compatible with the Platform.</li>
            <li>Connect Your Wallet: Follow the prompts to securely connect your wallet to the Platform.</li>
            <li>Authorize Access: Grant the necessary permissions to allow the Platform to interact with your wallet.</li>
            <li>Complete Registration: Once your wallet is connected, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Security:</strong> Maintaining the security of your Play2Earn account is your responsibility. This includes safeguarding your account name (crypto wallet ID number), password, and monitoring all activities within your account. Play2Earn is not liable for any losses or damages arising from unauthorized access or use of your account.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use or access to your account, please notify us immediately so we can take appropriate action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">
          4. BALANCE AND PAYOUTS
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Balance:</strong> Your earnings will always be shown on the Platform in their equivalent value of P2E Tokens. This does not mean you own the P2E Tokens until you request a Payout. When you click the "Transfer to My Wallet" button, we will transfer P2E Tokens equivalent to the value of your earnings at that time.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Payout:</strong> You can request a Payout up to the value of your earnings by clicking the “Transfer to My Wallet” button. P2E Tokens will be transferred to the crypto wallet connected to your account.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Gas Fee:</strong> Each Payout request incurs a blockchain transaction fee ("Gas Fee"). This fee will be deducted from your Payout and displayed during the request process. While there are no minimum earnings requirements to request a Payout, the transaction value must cover the Gas Fee.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Gas Fee Rate:</strong> The displayed Gas Fee may vary slightly from the actual amount deducted due to fluctuations in blockchain transaction fees.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Risks:</strong> P2E Tokens, like any cryptocurrency, offers benefits but also comes with certain risks. These risks may include fluctuations in the value of P2E Tokens or limitations on its use and liquidity. As the Platform provides Payouts in P2E Tokens, we encourage you to carefully consider and understand these risks to ensure they align with your personal circumstances and goals before using the Platform.
        </p>
